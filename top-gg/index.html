    <h3>TLDR: Top.gg have done some rather questionable things, check out our wumpus.store instead: <a href="https://wumpus.store/bot/966695034340663367">click</a></h3>
    <p>It's important to keep in mind current state of top.gg before the events occurred. The website was not maintained at all, and many critical things (vote replies and pages, profile pictures, languages popup etc etc etc) were completely broken. To their credit, they seem to have fixed review stuff but ummmm</p>
    <p>On February 1st 2024, top.gg announced they will be discontinuing the vote credits program.</p>
    <p><img alt="Image" src="/topgg1.png"></p>
    <p>For those unaware, top.gg gave you a fraction of a cent when someone votes which you can use in auctions to advertise your bot throughout the website, which they just removed in order to leave those spots only for paying customers to generate more profit.</p>
    <p>This is further confirmed by them adding tons of ads to every page. Now bot devs should encourage people watching thousands of ads for:</p>

    <p>On February 6th, 5 days later, they announced they will be removing server listings. I'm not too mad as I didn't use this but "some tough news" isn't good for this situation.</p>
    <p><img alt="Image" src="/topgg3.png"></p>
    <p>The dumpster fire continued by reviews completely vanishing from every single bot page:</p>
    <p><img alt="Image" src="/topgg4.png"></p>
    <p>Additionally, you couldn't edit any bot pages due to a bug with tags feature, but I didn't take any screenshots unfortunately.</p>
    <p>This was enough for me, so I deleted Cat Bot's page the same day, but today I discovered it was rolled back. If that's how you wanna play let that be it.</p>
    <p><img alt="Image" src="/topgg5.png"></p>
    <p>As an alternative, I would recommend a small new bot listing website wumpus.store from the creators of TempVoice, which is fast, pretty and supports full migration of bots from top.gg. I would recommend any bot devs check it out.</p>
